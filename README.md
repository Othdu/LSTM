## Initialize the CNNLSTM model

Sets up the layers for the CNN-LSTM architecture, including:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers for downsampling
- LSTM layer for temporal processing
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully connected layers for classification

The model is designed to process sequences of images, extract spatial features using CNN, and then process the temporal information using LSTM.
